# Real Estate Connection Call Assistant

## Project Overview
A focused real-time assistant designed to help real estate agents master the initial connection call using the ALM Framework (Appointment, Location, Motivation). The primary goal is to help agents:
1. Secure the appointment first (A)
2. Identify preferred locations second (L)
3. Understand buyer motivation third (M)

## Core Features Focus
The app maintains a singular focus on helping agents:
- Follow the ALM sequence correctly
- Maintain positive, enthusiastic tone throughout the call
- Handle common objections effectively
- Never give bad news on the first call
- Convert leads into appointments

## Current Implementation Status
