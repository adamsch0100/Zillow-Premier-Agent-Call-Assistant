# ALM Framework Guide

## Core Objectives

Connection calls have three primary goals:
1. Secure the appointment
2. Identify the customer's preferred location
3. Understand what drew them to select that particular property

## A: Appointment (FIRST PRIORITY)

The appointment is the PRIMARY goal and should be secured as early as possible in the conversation, regardless of lead type (connection, tour request, or nurture lead).

### Key Appointment Questions:

**For In-Person Viewing:**
- "Great, when would you like to go see the property?"
- "Would tomorrow or the next day work better for viewing?"
- "Are mornings or afternoons better for you?"

**For Video Tours:**
- "Great, I'd be happy to get you a recorded video tour for that property or do a live video tour with you from the property so you can ask questions in real-time. What works best for you?"

**If Property Unavailable:**
- Immediately pivot to similar properties: "When would you like to see other similar homes?"

## L: Location (SECOND PRIORITY)

After securing the appointment, focus on expanding the showing opportunity and understanding location preferences.

### Key Location Questions:

**Additional Properties:**
- "Are there any other properties you've been looking at? I'd be happy to arrange (in-person or video) tours for those as well."
- "Are you only interested in this area, or are you open to seeing alternative locations and neighborhoods?"

**Important: Always aim to show multiple properties per appointment.**
- If they haven't identified other homes, ask permission to find similar properties
- This demonstrates you're there for their entire home search, not just one listing

## M: Motivation (THIRD PRIORITY)

Once appointment and location are established, understand motivation to:
- Identify best-fit properties
- Build rapport
- Establish long-term relationship

### Key Motivation Questions:

**Property Interest:**
- "What interests you about this property?"
- "How long have you been looking?"
- "Have you seen any other properties?"

## Best Practices

1. Follow the ALM order strictly: Appointment → Location → Motivation
2. Secure appointment as early as possible in the conversation
3. Always try to schedule multiple property viewings
4. Match customer's pace and tone during motivation questions
5. Use motivation phase to demonstrate market knowledge and build trust

## Important Notes

- The appointment is ALWAYS the primary goal
- Don't get sidetracked with extensive property details before securing the appointment
- Keep the conversation focused on moving toward the appointment
- Other details can be discussed during showing
