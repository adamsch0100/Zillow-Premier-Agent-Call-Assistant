## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of the core ALM framework
2. Develop the call opening module

- Maintain flexibility for different client scenarios

## Development Log

### November 20, 2024 - Development History and Conversations

#### Session 1: Initial Project Setup and Framework Implementation
- Project analyzed and core ALM framework identified as priority
- Created initial database models and migrations
- Implemented conversation templates and analyzer
- Built speech processing system

#### Session 2: Project Cleanup and Refocus
AI: Let's clean up the project structure and remove duplicates.
Human: "Please continue. And please make sure you are saving our conversation somehow that it is easy to restart if you freeze."
AI: Acknowledged. Will clean up project and maintain conversation history in project_status.md.

Current Focus: Project cleanup and reorganization
- Reviewing all files and directories
- Identifying duplicate implementations
- Consolidating core functionality
- Maintaining conversation history

Issues Identified:
1. Duplicate model locations:
   - /src/backend/models/
   - /src/backend/app/models/
2. Multiple service implementations
3. Duplicate project status files

Next Steps:
1. Remove duplicate files
2. Consolidate core functionality
3. Update documentation
4. Continue with focused ALM implementation

### Conversation History

Session 1: Initial project setup and ALM framework implementation
Session 2: Project cleanup initiated
Session 3: Project continuation and frontend development
Human: "please go to home/computeruse/real-estate-assistant and continue building the project. reference project_status.md, and continue updating the file as we build out."
AI: Continued development with focus on frontend components and WebSocket implementation.

After reviewing the existing /src/backend/app/services/alm_manager.py and project structure, implemented:
1. Frontend Components:
   - Created SuggestionPanel.jsx for real-time suggestion display
   - Implemented ALM progress tracking interface
   - Added responsive styling with SuggestionPanel.css

2. WebSocket Communication:
   - Implemented WebSocketManager for real-time updates
   - Added support for audio streaming
   - Created robust error handling and reconnection logic

#### Current Status
1. Project Analysis
   - Reviewed project structure and documentation
   - Analyzed current implementation status
   - Identified core ALM framework as immediate priority

2. Implemented Core Components
   - Created comprehensive conversation templates and scripts
   - Developed real-time conversation analyzer with ALM framework
   - Implemented speech processing system with VAD (Voice Activity Detection)
   - Set up models for appointments, clients, properties, and search preferences
   - Added frontend components for real-time interaction
   - Implemented WebSocket communication layer

3. Features Completed:
   - Opening script templates for various scenarios
