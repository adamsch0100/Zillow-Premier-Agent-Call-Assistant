## Development Log

### November 20, 2024 - Development History and Conversations

#### Session 1: Initial Project Setup and Framework Implementation
- Project analyzed and core ALM framework identified as priority
- Created initial database models and migrations
- Implemented conversation templates and analyzer
- Built speech processing system

#### Session 2: Project Cleanup and Refocus
AI: Let's clean up the project structure and remove duplicates.
Human: "Please continue. And please make sure you are saving our conversation somehow that it is easy to restart if you freeze."
AI: Acknowledged. Will clean up project and maintain conversation history in project_status.md.

Current Focus: Project cleanup and reorganization
- Reviewing all files and directories
- Identifying duplicate implementations
- Consolidating core functionality
- Maintaining conversation history

Issues Identified:
1. Duplicate model locations:

2. Multiple service implementations
3. Duplicate project status files

Next Steps:
1. Remove duplicate files
2. Consolidate core functionality
3. Update documentation
4. Continue with focused ALM implementation

### Conversation History

Session 1: Initial project setup and ALM framework implementation
Session 2: Project cleanup initiated
Session 3: Project continuation and frontend development
Human: "please go to home/computeruse/real-estate-assistant and continue building the project. reference project_status.md, and continue updating the file as we build out."
AI: Continued development with focus on frontend components and WebSocket implementation.
